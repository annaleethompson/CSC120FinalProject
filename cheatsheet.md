If your game includes challenges that must be overcome to win, also list them below.

    When the user accuses a person, room, and weapon, if they get only a portion (1 or 2) aspects of the crime correct then they can go back into the house and search for clues but they only have 20 minutes to do so. This is because once the user has any aspect of the crime correct the murderer will begin to come after the user putting them under pressure to find clues.
